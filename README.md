# Code for the paper Adversarial Feature Augmentation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

Step 0: training a classifier on source data.

Step 1: training a feature generator to perform feature augmentation in the source feature space.

Step 2: training an encoder by adapting it to the source features, relying on the pre-trained feature generator.
